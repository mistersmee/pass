# Password store
These is my remote repo for my passwords stored in zx2c4's [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), the "standard Unix password manager".
Intended only to make life easier for me to move my passwords from device to device.

Also is _relatively_ safe, because it is encrypted with my gpg private key, which only I have.

See [here](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#is-my-repository-safe-as-a-public-repo) for more info on the topic.
